      "The application allows you to download files from a specific directory",
      "Try using special characters like ../ to navigate the file system",

    ],
    "solution_steps": [
      "Access the file server homepage to see available files",
      "Notice the download functionality uses a 'file' parameter",
      "Try accessing /download?file=../flag.txt to go up one directory",
      "If that doesn't work, try /download?file=../../flag.txt",
      "Continue adding ../ sequences until you reach the root directory",
      "The flag is in /flag.txt, so use: /download?file=../../../flag.txt"
