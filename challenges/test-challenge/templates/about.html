    <h1>About This Challenge</h1>

    <div class="about-section">
        <h2>What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?</h2>
        <p>Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) is a security vulnerability that occurs when a web application includes untrusted data in a web page without proper validation or escaping. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts that execute in the victim's browser.</p>

        <h3>Types of XSS</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Reflected XSS</strong>: Malicious script is reflected off a web server, such as in an error message or search result</li>
            <li><strong>Stored XSS</strong>: Malicious script is permanently stored on the target server</li>
            <li><strong>DOM-based XSS</strong>: Vulnerability exists in client-side code rather than server-side</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>This Challenge</h3>
        <p>This challenge focuses on <strong>Reflected XSS</strong>. The vulnerability exists in the search functionality where user input is reflected back to the page without proper sanitization.</p>

        <h3>Learning Objectives</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand how XSS vulnerabilities occur</li>
            <li>Learn to identify potential injection points</li>
            <li>Practice crafting basic XSS payloads</li>
            <li>Understand the impact and risks of XSS attacks</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Prevention</h3>
        <p>XSS vulnerabilities can be prevented by:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Properly encoding/escaping user input</li>
            <li>Using Content Security Policy (CSP) headers</li>
            <li>Validating and sanitizing input on both client and server side</li>
            <li>Using modern frameworks with built-in XSS protection</li>
        </ul>
