<task type="checkpoint:human-verify">
  <what-built>Complete discovery interface with challenge browsing, filtering, spawning, and progress tracking</what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Start the Flask API server: `cd /home/mark/sec-prac && npm run api:start`
    2. Start the Next.js frontend: `cd /home/mark/sec-prac/frontend && npm run dev`
    3. Open browser to http://localhost:3000
    4. Test discovery interface:
       - Verify challenges load and display in table/grid view
       - Test search functionality by typing in search box
       - Test difficulty and category filters
       - Test table sorting by different columns
       - Test challenge detail modal opens with complete information
    5. Test challenge workflow:
       - Click spawn button on a challenge
       - Verify container spawning works and shows session info
       - Test flag submission with correct and incorrect flags
       - Verify challenge stop functionality
    6. Test progress tracking:
       - Complete a challenge successfully
       - Check progress dashboard shows updated statistics
       - Verify completion indicators appear in discovery interface
    7. Test URL state management:
       - Apply filters and verify URL updates
       - Copy URL and open in new tab - filters should be preserved
       - Test browser back/forward navigation
    8. Test responsive design:
       - Test interface on mobile/tablet screen sizes
       - Verify table switches to card view on small screens
       - Check modal responsiveness
    9. Test error handling:
       - Stop API server and verify error states display properly
       - Test invalid challenge IDs and API errors
