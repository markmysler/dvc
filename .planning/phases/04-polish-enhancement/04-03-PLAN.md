<task type="checkpoint:human-verify" gate="blocking">
  <what-built>
    Complete platform polish and enhancement including:
    - Enhanced UI components with professional shadcn/ui styling
    - Challenge import validation system with security checks
    - Challenge import UI workflow with wizard and validation feedback
    - Discovery interface integration for imported challenges
    - Developer validation helper script
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Start services: `docker compose up -d` and `cd frontend && npm run dev`

    2. **UI Polish Verification:**
       - Visit http://localhost:3000 (main discovery interface)
       - Verify all components display consistent shadcn/ui professional styling
       - Check loading states are smooth with content-aware skeletons
       - Confirm hover effects, animations, and transitions are professional
       - Verify responsive design works across different screen sizes

    3. **Challenge Import Workflow:**
       - Navigate to http://localhost:3000/import
       - Test guided import wizard workflow
       - Upload valid challenge JSON (use existing challenges/definitions/challenges.json as test)
       - Verify validation feedback is clear and helpful
       - Test error handling with invalid challenge file (remove required field)
       - Confirm validation errors provide specific fix suggestions

    4. **Discovery Interface Integration:**
       - After successful import, return to http://localhost:3000 (discovery interface)
       - Verify imported challenges appear alongside built-in challenges
       - Confirm imported challenges have visual indicator (badge/icon)
       - Test spawning an imported challenge works exactly like built-in challenges
       - Verify challenge cards maintain consistent enhanced styling

    5. **Development Validation:**
       - Run `node scripts/validate-challenge.js challenges/definitions/challenges.json`
       - Verify helper script provides immediate validation feedback
       - Test with invalid challenge file to see error reporting

    6. **Security Validation:**
       - Test validation rejects challenges with privileged: true
       - Verify container security checks prevent dangerous configurations
       - Confirm file upload size limits and security measures work

    **Concrete Acceptance Criteria:**
    - [ ] All UI components use consistent shadcn/ui styling (no custom CSS overrides visible)
    - [ ] Import wizard completes successfully with valid challenge file
    - [ ] Validation errors display with specific field names and fix suggestions
    - [ ] Imported challenges appear in discovery interface with "Imported" badge
    - [ ] Imported challenge spawning works identically to built-in challenges
    - [ ] Developer validation script exits 0 for valid files, non-zero for invalid
    - [ ] Security validation prevents privileged containers (shows specific error)
    - [ ] File upload rejects files larger than expected limits
    - [ ] Loading states display properly during validation (skeleton components visible)
    - [ ] Responsive design works on mobile/tablet screen sizes
  </how-to-verify>
  <resume-signal>Type "approved" if all 10 acceptance criteria pass, or describe which specific criteria failed with details</resume-signal>
